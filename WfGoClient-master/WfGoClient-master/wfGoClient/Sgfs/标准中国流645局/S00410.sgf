];B[fq]LB[cn:A]C[This is exactly the same opening as in the first game
of the 1998 Kisei match between Cho and Yoda but
with the colors reversed! In that game Yoda continued
with A (see variation).
];W[ip];B[cn]LB[cq:B]LB[fo:A]C[Other ways to play this position is
to jump to A or invade at B (see
variations).
];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[dq]LB[cq:A]C[This move can also be played at A (variation).
];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[gr];W[cq];B[dr];W[go]C[All these moves are joseki.
];B[cj];W[hp]LB[cr:A]C[Thick move, in this position a good choice.
With this strong white position the black
formation on the right side looks thin.
Black has to answer this move since white
threatens to play A.

more ambituous at the top. Please note
that since white B is nearly sente (see diagram)
white A has an immediate threat of white C as
follow-up.
];B[lc]C[Natural since the top is an important area.
];W[ld]LB[qc:A]C[If white plays the normal move (A, see variation)
black gets what he wants.
];B[kd];W[md];B[qc]LB[ke:A]C[Takemiya Masaki prefers A because the center
is important in this game.
];W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jd];W[lb];B[eh];W[dg];B[pi]C[Not to the point, Takemiya suggests the
strategy as in the variation.
];W[og]C[After seeing this move Yoda probably realized
that his previous move was bad. If white wins
this game then this move might be called the
winning move.
];B[of]LB[pg:A]C[This move is unnatural: black's previous
move defended the side, so natural would
be to defend with A (see diagram).
];W[ng]C[Correct shape, the variation explains why.
];B[nf]LB[jg:A]C[Black cannot play tenuki with A, see diagram.
];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[mh]LB[lg:A]C[Good style. Black A would be bad style, see variation.
];W[hg]LB[jf:A]C[A good move, white has to attack the three stones
at the top on a large scale. White A would be too small.
];B[eg];W[ge]C[Virtually captures the black stones at the top.
];B[df]C[The sealed move of the first day.
];W[cf];B[ig]C[Takemiya expected that black would sacrifice
the stones as shown in the variation.
];W[if];B[jf];W[jg];B[ih];W[jh]LB[ie:A]C[Commenting professionals prefered white A
as in the variation.
];B[ji];W[ki];B[hf];W[ie];B[he];W[hd];B[gf];W[id]C[Last move before the lunch break on the second day.
];B[ii];W[fe];B[kj];W[li];B[ni];W[lj];B[kk];W[po];B[qp]LB[np:A]C[This black move seems to indicate that
Yoda (black) is confident abbout the outcome
of the game. However, general opinion amongst
the attending professionals was that black should
play more positive with A instead (see variation).
];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[nq];W[lo]C[White connecting his stones is the correct strategy.
];B[np];W[no];B[on];W[oo];B[ff];W[kg]LB[kh:A]C[Preventing the cut at A.
];B[hl];W[qo];B[mq];W[lq];B[lr];W[kq];B[mn];W[mo];B[qb]C[Very big move, worth around 20 points.
];W[ro];B[rq]C[Correct style, see variation for the reason.

Probably he only considered black A (variation).
];W[lm];B[mk]TR[oj]TR[nj]C[Black cuts off the two marked stones
(see variations), thus deciding the game.
